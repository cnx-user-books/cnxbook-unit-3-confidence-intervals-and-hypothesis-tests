Every cell phone emits RF energy. Different phone models have different SAR measures. To receive certification from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for sale in the United States, the SAR level for a cell phone must be no more than 1.6 watts per kilogram. Table 7.1 shows the highest SAR level for a random selection of cell phone models as measured by the FCC.
A recent study has shown that if a cell phone's SAR level exceeds 0.9 watts per kilogram, there is an increased chance of brain tumours for those that use this phone<footnote id="uid2">This is completely made-up.</footnote> An advocacy group wants to use this new study to petition the FCC to change their regulations around the current allowable SAR levels.

Historically, men made many of the financial decisions including the decision on whether to make major household purchases (such as buying a new vehicle or doing a renovation), while women were left out of them. To investigate whether this has changed, the magazine is considering doing a study to find out the percentage of couples who are equally involved in making decision about household purchases.

        <item id="uid40">Question 6: Suppose that an accounting firm has developed a new software to help their clients do their taxes more quickly. Based off of a national survey, most people spend 24.4 hours completing their personal income taxes a year. The accounting firm has a random sample of 100 of their clients complete their 2016 income tax return using the new software. The sample mean time to complete the tax returns is 23.6 hours with a standard deviation of 7.0 hours. The firm doesn't want to release the software unless they are sure it will reduce the time it takes clients to do their taxes. The population distribution is assumed to be normal.

              <item id="uid66">Since the sample size is less than 30, we can only assume the sampling distribution is normal if the population distribution is close to being normal. Based on the normal curve plot and the empirical rule, it appears that the sample is not normally distributed. The normal curve plot is not a straight line and only 55.6% of the data fall within the first standard deviation of this. This conclusion is supported by a bimodal histogram. This suggests that the population distribution is not normal, which means we cannot be certain the sampling distribution is normal.
Regardless of your answer in b), assume that the sampling distribution is normal for the remaining questions.

Since this is a one population proportions test, we want to use the standard normal distribution to model it. We need to check two things:

<item>Is the sampling distribution of sample proportions normal? Yes, as the number of successes (512) and the number of failures (2247-512 =1735) are both at least 5. </item></list>
Therefore, we will use the standard normal distribution to model this situation. </item>
